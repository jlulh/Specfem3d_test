 Time:   -3.95999998E-02  seconds
 Elapsed time in seconds =    3.5578399999997012E-004
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =      0 h 00 m 00 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =    7.1156799999994019E-005
 Max norm displacement vector U in all slices (m) =    8.38141277E-05
 Time steps done =            5  out of         2000
 Time steps remaining =         1995
 Estimated remaining time in seconds =   0.14195781599998808     
 Estimated remaining time in hh:mm:ss =      0 h 00 m 00 s
 Estimated total run time in seconds =   0.14231359999998805     
 Estimated total run time in hh:mm:ss =      0 h 00 m 00 s
 We have done   0.250000000     % of that
